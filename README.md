TeleBot is an AI-based virtual assistant built to support telemedicine. The system allows users to enter their symptoms in a simple format. It uses a Decision Tree algorithm to predict possible diseases and then suggests relevant doctors based on the diagnosis. It was developed using Python, Tkinter, and scikit-learn, and stores doctor and symptom data in CSV files.
The chatbot has three main parts:
A user registration system,
A symptom-based diagnostic chatbot, and
A doctor recommendation module.
